Thus, a contact exists between two motes if there is at least one interaction between them during the day, and the duration of the contact is the total duration of all interactions between these two motes. Because the beaconing frequency of a mote is 0.05 s−1, an interaction of length 3 (in CPRs) corresponds to an interaction of about 1 min (SI Text and references therein). The entire dataset consists of 762,868 interactions with a mean duration of 2.8 CPRs (∼1 min), or 118,291 contacts with mean duration of 18.1 CPRs (∼6 min).\n",

    "The four folders correspond to four strategies of calculating interactions or contacts from a set of CPRs (recall that an interaction between two motes is defined as a continuous sequence of CPRs, and a contact is the sum of all interactions). There are two parameters that are of importance: minimumDuration and dropoff. The parameter minimumDuration defines the minimum duration (in CPRs) for an interaction or contact (depending on the strategy - see below) to be considered. The dropoff parameter allows you to assume that the dataset might be missing CPRs, and dropoff allows you to define the number of CPRs that should be considered as a maximum dropoff value. The examples below should make this clear.\n",
